# Orthopedic Condition Diagnosis using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Description
This project aims to diagnose orthopedic conditions as abnormal or normal using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Biomechanical features of orthopedic patients are analyzed to determine whether the condition is within normal parameters or if abnormalities are present.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "column_2C_weka.csv", which contains biomechanical features and corresponding class labels for orthopedic patients.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language used for implementation
- Pandas: Library used for data processing
- NumPy: Library used for numerical computations
- Matplotlib: Library used for data visualization
- scikit-learn: Library providing machine learning tools, including the KNN algorithm
